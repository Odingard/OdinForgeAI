What It Takes to Add True Validation (AEV)
Phase 1: Safe Validation Primitives
1. HTTP Request/Response Capture
•	Intercept and log actual HTTP exchanges during testing
•	Store raw requests/responses as evidence artifacts
•	Diff responses to detect behavioral differences (blind SQLi, auth bypass)
2. Payload Library (Non-Destructive)
•	Canary tokens (callback URLs to prove code execution)
•	Polyglot payloads for SQLi/XSS detection
•	Time-based detection payloads (SLEEP, WAITFOR)
•	Out-of-band detection (DNS callbacks)
3. Protocol Probes
•	SMTP relay testing (actually send test email)
•	DNS zone transfer attempts (AXFR query)
•	LDAP anonymous bind check
•	Default credential checks (SSH, FTP, databases)
 
Phase 2: Validation Execution Engine
4. Sandboxed Execution Environment
•	Isolated runtime for payload delivery
•	Network egress controls (prevent lateral damage)
•	Timeout and resource limits
•	Kill switch integration
5. Exploit Modules (Safe Mode)
Module	What It Validates
SQLi Validator	Time-based blind, error-based, UNION detection
XSS Validator	DOM injection, reflected payload echo
Auth Bypass	Session fixation, JWT none-algorithm
SSRF Validator	Internal resource fetch via callback
RCE Validator	Canary token callback to prove execution
Path Traversal	Attempt to read known files (etc/passwd, win.ini)
6. Agent-Based Validation
•	Use deployed Go agents to validate from inside the network
•	Agents execute validation probes (not user-provided code)
•	Confirm internal reachability, credential reuse paths
 
Phase 3: Evidence & Confidence
7. Evidence Collection System
•	Raw HTTP request/response pairs
•	Screenshots (for web-based findings)
•	Timing data (for time-based detection)
•	Callback logs (for out-of-band validation)
8. Validation Confidence Scoring
Level	Meaning
Confirmed	Exploit executed successfully, evidence captured
Likely	Behavioral indicators present, partial validation
Theoretical	AI analysis only, no execution attempted
False Positive	Validation attempted, not exploitable
 
Phase 4: Compliance & Safety
9. Execution Modes
•	Safe Mode: Non-destructive validation only (canaries, timing)
•	Simulation Mode: Full validation in isolated/test environment
•	Live Mode: Real validation against production (requires approval)
10. Audit Trail
•	Every validation attempt logged with timestamp, target, payload, result
•	Immutable audit log for compliance
•	Approval workflow for live mode execution
 
Estimated Effort
Component	Complexity	Dependencies
HTTP capture + evidence	Medium	None
Payload library	Medium	Security research
Protocol probes	Medium	Net libraries
SQLi/XSS validators	High	Payload library
Agent-based validation	High	Agent protocol extension
Sandboxed execution	High	Container/isolation tech
Audit/approval workflow	Medium	RBAC already exists
 
What This Changes
Before (Current):
"Our AI says this might be SQLi based on the code pattern"
After (True AEV):
"We confirmed SQLi by injecting ' OR SLEEP(5)-- and observed 5.02s response delay. Evidence attached."
