Replit Instruction: OdinForge Agent Deployment Must Be Streamlined to ONLY 2 Install Methods

Goal: Provide a single “Install Agent” experience that supports Windows, Linux, Kubernetes, and containers, but only through two installation methods:

A) Host Install Method (Windows + Linux)

Requirements
	1.	Create one universal entrypoint command that users run:
	•	If Windows → run PowerShell installer
	•	If Linux → run bash installer
	2.	The scripts must:
	•	Detect OS and architecture
	•	Download correct agent binary
	•	Write config file (server URL, API key, tenant ID)
	•	Install and start as a system service
	•	Provide status command
	•	Provide uninstall command
	3.	Provide one copy/paste command for each OS (Windows and Linux), but keep it under the same “Host Install” method in the UI.

Deliverables
	•	install.ps1 (Windows)
	•	install.sh (Linux)
	•	Both scripts:
	•	accept --server-url, --api-key, --tenant-id
	•	default secure behavior
	•	support --dry-run and --force
	•	Scripts must call existing agent CLI:
odinforge-agent install ...

B) Container Install Method (K8s + Containers)

Requirements
	1.	Provide one container-based deployment method:
	•	Docker run (for containers)
	•	Helm chart (for Kubernetes)
	2.	Both must:
	•	Use the same env vars:
	•	ODINFORGE_SERVER_URL
	•	ODINFORGE_API_KEY
	•	ODINFORGE_TENANT_ID
	•	Run the agent in “daemon” mode
	•	Support persistent queue volume mount
	3.	The Helm chart must:
	•	deploy as DaemonSet (one per node)
	•	mount host metrics endpoints if needed
	•	allow optional mTLS in values.yaml
	•	include RBAC + ServiceAccount

Deliverables
	•	deploy/docker-run.md with a single command
	•	deploy/helm/ Helm chart for K8s (DaemonSet)
	•	Optional: deploy/compose.yaml

UI Requirement (Most Important)

On the OdinForge “Agents” page, show ONLY TWO buttons:
	1.	Host Install (Windows/Linux)
	2.	Container Install (K8s/Docker)

Each button outputs the correct copy/paste instructions. No other install methods should be presented.

Auto-Detection Requirement
	•	“Host Install” must auto-detect OS and fetch the right binary.
	•	“Container Install” must output either Docker or Helm based on user selection (dropdown is okay), but still treated as the same install method.

Acceptance Criteria
	•	A user can install the agent successfully in under 2 minutes using only those two methods.
	•	Works for Windows endpoints, Linux servers, Docker hosts, and Kubernetes clusters.
	•	No third install path exists in UI or docs.
