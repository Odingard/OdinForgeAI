OdinForge Platform – Product Implementation Status (Rough Draft)

Product Overview (Current State)

OdinForge is an AI-powered exposure validation and attack simulation platform that extends beyond traditional CVE scanning to include cloud abuse, IAM exploitation, SaaS misconfiguration, and business logic vulnerabilities. The platform combines agent-based telemetry, AI-driven analysis, evidence-backed scoring, and executive-ready risk visualization.

The application is currently fully functional, end-to-end tested, and operational in development with hot module reloading (HMR) confirming live updates.
