Most security tools tell you what MIGHT happen.

OdinForge shows you what WILL happen — by actually exploiting vulnerabilities and chaining them into breach paths.

Simulation vs. validation is the difference between a fire drill and a real fire.

Pentera charges $100K+/year with a 500-IP minimum.

NodeZero won't even show you pricing without a sales call.

We built OdinForge because security validation shouldn't require a Fortune 500 budget.

Full-stack breach simulation. Transparent pricing. Free trial.

What OdinForge does in 60 seconds:

1. Maps your attack surface (infra, cloud, network, web)
2. Discovers real vulnerabilities
3. Chains them into breach paths
4. Visualizes the full attack graph
5. Tells you exactly what to fix first

No agents. No source code needed. Try it free.

We just published honest, side-by-side comparisons against the biggest names in security validation:

vs Pentera: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/pentera
vs NodeZero: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/nodezero
vs AttackIQ: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/attackiq

No spin. Just facts. See where we go further.
```

### Tweet 6 (engagement bait)
```
Hot take: If your security validation tool requires deploying agents on every endpoint, it's testing your change management process, not your security.

Real attackers don't install agents first.
```

### Tweet 7 (thread starter)
```
Why we built OdinForge (thread):

I spent years watching security teams pay $100K+ for tools that run scripted playbooks and call it "validation."

Meanwhile, actual attackers don't follow playbooks. They adapt. They chain. They find the path of least resistance.

That's what OdinForge does — autonomously.

Autonomous breach simulation platform. Find what attackers find, before they do.
```

### About / Long Description
```
OdinForge AI is an adversarial exposure validation (AEV) platform that autonomously simulates real-world attacks against your infrastructure, cloud environments, networks, and web applications.

Unlike traditional vulnerability scanners that generate lists of CVEs, OdinForge chains real vulnerabilities into full breach paths — showing you exactly how an attacker would move through your environment from initial access to full compromise.

No agents. No source code required. Visual attack graph visualization. Prioritized remediation guidance.

```

### Post 1 (Launch announcement)
```
OdinForge AI is live.

We built an autonomous breach simulation platform that does what expensive pentest engagements do — but continuously, automatically, and at a fraction of the cost.

Point it at your environment. It maps your attack surface, finds real vulnerabilities, chains them into breach paths, and shows you exactly what to fix.

No agents to deploy. No source code needed. Interactive attack graph visualization that makes sense to both engineers and executives.

### Post 2 (Comparison angle)
```
How does OdinForge stack up against the big names in security validation?

We published honest, side-by-side comparisons:

OdinForge vs Pentera — Why pay $100K+ for an on-prem appliance?
https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/pentera

OdinForge vs NodeZero — Enterprise-grade validation, accessible pricing.
https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/nodezero

OdinForge vs AttackIQ — Don't just simulate. Validate.
https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/attackiq

No spin. Just facts.
```

### Post 3 (Educational)
```
Your vulnerability scanner found 847 CVEs. Now what?

The problem with traditional scanning: it tells you everything that COULD be a problem, but not what actually IS a problem. Security teams drown in false positives and low-priority findings.

OdinForge takes a different approach. Instead of listing every possible vulnerability, it chains real exploitable weaknesses into attack paths — showing you the 3-4 things an attacker would actually use to breach your environment.

Fix the path, not the list.

### r/cybersecurity — Main launch post

**Title:** `I built an autonomous breach simulation platform — here's what I learned about the AEV market`

**Body:**
```
Hey r/cybersecurity,

I've been building OdinForge AI — an adversarial exposure validation (AEV) platform that autonomously chains real vulnerabilities into breach paths across infrastructure, cloud, network, and web applications.

The problem I was trying to solve: traditional pentests are expensive ($50-200K), happen once a year, and the report sits in a drawer. Vulnerability scanners generate thousands of findings with no context on what actually matters. BAS tools run scripted playbooks but don't prove real exploitability.

What OdinForge does differently:
- Autonomous exploitation — not scripted playbooks, actual vulnerability chaining
- Full attack surface — infra, cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), network, web apps, APIs
- Visual breach chains — interactive attack graphs, not 200-page PDF reports
- Agentless — no endpoint agents, no source code required
- Prioritized remediation — tells you what to fix first based on actual breach impact

I also published honest comparison pages against the major players:
- vs Pentera: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/pentera
- vs NodeZero: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/nodezero
- vs AttackIQ: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/attackiq

Free 14-day trial is open. Happy to answer any questions about the architecture, approach, or the AEV market in general.

### r/netsec — Technical angle

**Title:** `Autonomous breach chain analysis: chaining CVEs into real attack paths`

**Body:**
```
I've been working on an approach to security validation that goes beyond individual CVE detection — autonomously chaining exploitable vulnerabilities into full breach paths.

The core idea: instead of testing individual vulnerabilities in isolation (like traditional BAS), the system maps the attack surface, identifies exploitable weaknesses, and then autonomously determines how an attacker would chain them together — from initial access through lateral movement to full compromise.

The output is an interactive attack graph showing the complete breach chain with evidence at each step.

Built this into a platform called OdinForge AI. Covers infrastructure, cloud, network, and web application attack surfaces. Agentless, black-box approach.

Technical comparisons against existing tools:
- vs Pentera (automated pentesting): https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/pentera
- vs NodeZero (autonomous pentesting): https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/nodezero
- vs AttackIQ (BAS/control validation): https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/attackiq

Free trial: https://www.odinforgeai.com

Interested in feedback from the community on the approach, especially around attack chaining methodology and false positive rates.
```

### r/sysadmin — Practical angle

**Title:** `Free tool for automated security validation — no agents, no $100K budget needed`

**Body:**
```
For anyone managing infrastructure security without a dedicated red team or six-figure security tool budget:

I built OdinForge AI — an autonomous breach simulation tool that scans your infrastructure, cloud environments, and network for real exploitable vulnerabilities, then chains them into attack paths showing how an attacker would actually get in.

Why I think this is useful for sysadmins:
- No agents to deploy or manage on endpoints
- Visual attack graphs (easier to explain to management than a 50-page pentest report)
- Tells you what to fix FIRST based on actual breach impact, not just CVSS scores
- Covers infra, cloud, network, and web apps from one tool
- Free 14-day trial, no credit card

Not trying to replace your existing tools — this complements vulnerability scanners by showing which findings actually matter in context.

Happy to answer questions.

## 4. HACKER NEWS — Show HN

**Title:** `Show HN: OdinForge – Autonomous breach simulation for security teams`

**Body:**
```
Hi HN,

I built OdinForge AI, an adversarial exposure validation platform that autonomously finds and chains real vulnerabilities into breach paths.

The problem: annual pentests cost $50-200K, vulnerability scanners drown you in CVEs with no context, and BAS tools run scripted playbooks that don't prove real exploitability.

OdinForge takes a different approach — it autonomously maps your attack surface (infra, cloud, network, web apps), discovers exploitable weaknesses, and chains them into visual breach paths showing exactly how an attacker would move through your environment.

Key technical decisions:
- Agentless, black-box approach (like a real attacker)
- Multi-tenant with row-level security isolation
- Decoupled architecture: API server + separate BullMQ worker containers
- Interactive attack graph visualization (not PDF reports)
- Real exploitation with evidence, not signature-based simulation

Honest comparisons vs existing tools:
- vs Pentera: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/pentera
- vs NodeZero (Horizon3.ai): https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/nodezero
- vs AttackIQ: https://www.odinforgeai.com/compare/attackiq

Free 14-day trial: https://www.odinforgeai.com

Would love technical feedback from the community.

### Maker Comment (post on launch day)
```
Hey Product Hunt! I'm the maker of OdinForge AI.

I built this because I was tired of watching security teams choose between:
A) $100K+/year automated pentesting tools (Pentera, NodeZero)
B) Scripted BAS playbooks that don't prove real exploitability (AttackIQ)
C) Annual manual pentests that cost $50-200K and produce a report that sits in a drawer

OdinForge is option D: autonomous breach simulation that chains real vulnerabilities into attack paths, visualizes them as interactive graphs, and tells you exactly what to fix first.

Free 14-day trial, no credit card required. Would love your feedback!
